    "Avocados, often hailed as a superfruit, are packed with a wide array of vitamins and minerals. Owing to their extensive health benefits, they have sustained their popularity over the past decade, consistently featuring across various culinary presentations. The consumption of avocados have become significant over the past years, thus causing an increase in demand. Because of this, the price of avocados has been affected for a number of reasons. Factors such as the seasonality of avocado production, with specific periods favoring optimal growth, the type of avocado (organic or conventional), and the region of cultivation play a role in influencing avocado’s availability and quality<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1).\n",
    "\n",
    "Avocado prices fluctuate depending on the time of year. Tanmay Deshpande, the author of ‘Avocado Price Forecast,’ used Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) and Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model to find the correlation between the two types of avocado prices and the time of year. He discovered that the average prices of avocados fluctuate during a certain time of year as it would rise around September to November, but would drop again around December and January. This suggests that there may be more of a demand for avocados since they are seasonal fruits, which is why costs increase during a specific time of year in which they are produced<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the costs of avocados also vary depending on the region of which they are produced and sold for a number of reasons. Mario Caesar, author of  ‘Avocado Price Regression w/ PyCaret & EDA,’ discusses how different areas around the United States play a big role in the contribution of avocado sales and prices, especially with the size of the bag of avocados. His article expresses how the West (excluding California) and California are more likely to purchase both conventional and organic avocados—more so conventional—in comparison to the other top five areas that purchase avocados—the Northeast, Great Lakes and South Central, which begs the question as to why there is such a difference in avocado consumption between different regions. Additionally, the type of avocado that is produced also affects cost and people’s decision to purchase as they are grown using different methods. Caesar concludes that conventional avocados that are within bags are more likely to be purchased in comparison to organic avocados since they tend to be cheaper and bigger in volume and size. Even though organic avocados are produced in a better environment, their prices are higher for that reason<a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3). \n",

    "In the United States, avocado prices are primarily affected by their production method, where organic avocados command higher prices than conventional ones. Additionally, regional variations and seasonal demand fluctuations play critical roles in price determination, leading to higher prices in regions with scarce supply or elevated demand during certain seasons.\n",

    "This dataset provides comprehensive data on Hass avocado sales, sourced from the Hass Avocado Board. It builds on previous versions introduced on Kaggle by Justin Kiggins and later updated by Valentin Joseph to include data from 2015 up until 2021. This dataset categorizes sales data by various regions and key locations within the United States, including cities and sub-regions. Notably, the aggregation of location values doesn't equate to the total for regions, which are specified as California, West, Plains, South Central, Southeast, Midsouth, Great Lakes, and Northeast. This dataset offers valuable insights into avocado sales trends across different geographical areas. \n",

    "Our data doesn’t involve human subjects, so there is no concern for informed consent. They don’t have PII concerns. We believe the avocados will not request for their personal information to be removed. Overall, since we are not using human subjects, there should be no biases, privacy, or terms of concern. Furthermore, since we found our data online, we do not plan on deleting the data after using them. The price of avocados and their origins are transparent online. We do not consider securing the data since they are transparent and can be found online.\n", "\n",
    "One bias our dataset might have is that we can only include the avocados that are sold in bigger institutions, such as supermarkets. Smaller individuals, such as farmers selling small amounts of avocados might not be accounted for. However, since we are just focusing on the impact of regions and production methods on the prices, these small individual sellers shouldn’t do much on the statistics. Since they don’t have much impact on the overall avocado prices and they appear randomly, they can be disregarded in our data analysis. \n", "\n",
    "Another impact that our project will have is that we might come to conclusions of the avocados based on their origin. People might be inclined to buy avocados from one origin and discriminate against avocados from another origin. We will address this in our writeup by stating that our data is based on transparent data collected previously. Avocado prices in different areas might fluctuate in the future and become the opposite of our conclusions.\n"
